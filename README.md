# Bombparty bot (WIP)
Ruin your friend's day!

This bot only works for the jklm.fun version of bomb party

# How to use
Asuming many things (1080p monitor, regular zoom level etc.), this bot should work straight out of the box. Simply replace line 17 with where you have wordlist.txt stored

# Some extra steps if it does not work
Not everyone has a 1080p monitor so you may need to direct the bot at the correct spot to select the text. Simply replace line 27 with the position of the letters, use the top left of your screen as 0,0.

P.S: As of while I am typing this I am working on v2 which will have some new extra features
